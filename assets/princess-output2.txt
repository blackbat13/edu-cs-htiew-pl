so they put a rifle in my hand
fighting off the viet cong
born in the usa
i was born in the usa
the first kick i took was when i hit the ground
Im a long gone daddy in the usa
fighting off the viet cong
to go and kill the yellow man
he had a woman he loved in saigon
so they put a rifle in my hand
till you spend half your life just covering up
down in the shadow of the penitentiary
i was born in the usa
